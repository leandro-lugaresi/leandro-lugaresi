## Hi there :octocat:

I'm a software developer with 10 years of work experience dedicated to helping companies build high-quality, web applications that exceed their business objectives. 

My main focus is on backend development. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including Go (Golang), JavaScript and Typescript, but already worked with PHP and Ruby codebases.

âš¡ Currently, I am working mainly with Typescript, and studing different ways to build web apps using localfirst tecnologies.
